I just don't understand some of the other reviews.  You can't put make-up over top of the crud that it leaves behind. And how well can it work when I have to wipe it back off?\n",

I usually purchase a 15% glycolic acid from my dermatologist for about $ 45 and I was looking for a more cost effective alternative. This is not it. It does not work and feels like it is about a 5% concetration on my skin. I would not buy this product again.\n",
      "Who knows what they put in this container, definitely wasn't anything helpful or useful to my skin. Im sticking to products I know and trust. After a couple of weeks, no results or improvement I returned\n",
      "This product did not work for me.  I did not find that it was the right 'color' result, and i got a lot of streaking.  On the positive side, when i contacted the company they were very very helpful, offered an immediate refund and apologized that the product did not work for me.  (When it comes to self tanning products it is my experience that what works well for one person does not always work well for others)...So perhaps this product will work for you... and feel confident that if it doesn't, the company is great to deal with.\n",

      "This lotion is terrible. No awesome colors boost and not a hot tingle at all. I always use a tingle lotion and was very excited about this product, I just ended up being very disappointed. I wouldn't recomend it to anybody. The only good thing about it, it goes on your skin very nicely, not greasy at all.\n",
      "What can I say.  It sounded ideal, but for me it lasted only say 2 or 3 hours.  It certainly didn't last the day.  Tom's stick seems to work well and much better.\n",

      "Not what I expected not really wowed about the piece.\n",
      "I ordered this product thinking I would be getting a firmer brush, instead it is so soft, it does not clean well.  Especially for acne, one would expect better cleansing of pores.\n",
      "For the price, I thought it would be a miracle hand conditioner and it seems to provide no real benefit.  I believe more beneficial products are out there for a better price.\n",
      "This is a nice light lotion but it doesn't seem very good for stretch marks. I do love their body butter though.\n",
      "I loved the previous formula - except for the waiting time for the whitish color to disappear  - but it worked.  This new version goes on clear, but it not as effective.  I am very sensitive to the sun, so this was not strong enough for me for the summer sun.\n",
      "This goes on white. Have to rub in good. Leaves skin shiny. Seems more like a straight sunscreen than a hydrating cream w/ sunscreen. Not very appealing for the face\n",
      "The eye cream is too thick.  It didn't help the fine lines that much no better than what I was using.\n",
      "I didn't think Finulite would be a miracle but I expected to work better than it did. I used it every day, every night, but didn't get any results. It smells good and feels nice, but I can't say it worked for me. I've had better results whit way cheaper products.\n",
      "Maybe its just me.  I didn't feel like that lotion is really hydrate my skin.Price is nice and maybe it works for others.\n",
      "I have sensitive/oil skin and sometimes drying. This kit is ok because it won't dry your skin like Proactiv, but it wasn't strong enough for my skin.\n",
      "Love them both. The coconut oil is better than I expected.  Works wonders for cooking and really makes my skin look twice as healthy.  My husband loves the woodsy scent of the lostion\n",
      "Great quality product BUT NOT for sensitive skin, my skin is still bright red and I used it yesterday. super bummed.\n",
      "I like St. Ives products, but I wasn't too happy with this.  I did not like the way that it felt on my face, and my complexion did not look that good when I was using it.\n",

      "I like the product fine, but not worth the money. I don't really like it any better than my drugstore creams.\n",
      "This worked well enough but I did not like the smell. It was extremely artificial (watermelon gum?) for a &#34;natural&#34; product.\n",
      "I do not like this mist very well. The express tan is much better.  I do really like the towels.\n",
      "This product allows for an instant cooling effect but does not seem to help at all for long term.  Sometimes I wonder if it is better for the body to heal itself or if an ointment is more helpful.  In this case, the ointment doesn't seem effective other than a cooling effect (which does not last long).\n",
      "This is not very well concentrated and is therefore not worth the price.  This sort of item is best bought in a local store.\n",
      "Fits my clarisonic fine. The texture and thickness of brissels are not as soft as clarisonic though.\n",
      "Have not seen any improvement.  So far this product is not worth sending for.  Like many products  I just do not see the results !\n",
      "was excited to use this product. been using it for 3 weeks now and not even one shade lighter. not for me, now I'm just going to have to learn to love my underarms the way they are.\n",
      "I tried this produce at the advise of my sister who thought it was good.  I didn't have any luck with it and found that my old products worked just as good or better.\n",
      "Everything was nice and closed up good, but that needle is pretty big to pierce any nose, I don't think they even pierce tongues with that size.\n",
      "Just not really impressed in it keeping or lengthening the color of my tan. Would not buy again. Not worth the $$$$\n",
      "So I bought thinking it would be super safe by my little one. Well it might be safe but it is like putting plaster on him. It gets really thick and is hard to spread so therefore I feel like he is not getting good coverage.\n",
      "Like the brand do not like this fragrance.  It is not as moisturizing as the other hand and body lotions.\n",
      "I was excited to try the product, I see no color however.Disappointed.  The Glow Pads are MUCH better with a nice tan\n",
      "Well I just got mines today I really hope it work I'll keep you guys updated am really excited to see if it gonna work for me\n",
      "This cream is good for refreshing other than that didn't do anything I bought two I finishes both with no results I do work out and drink plenty water but didn't do anything.\n",
      "Didn't have any noticeable difference in my acne, I'm sure it might work for some people but it didn't for me. Good luck!\n",
      "I really like it it is a good cram for the skin. i really recommend this product for all girls.\n",
