       "164291    I got my jojoba oil in my shipment and it was scotch taped shut.  The seal on the inside was gone.  I am assuming this has been returned in the past, or someone filled it with another type of oil.  It smelled very different from the other one I have with the same brand.  This one almost smelled rancid.  I plan to return it and purchase somewhere else.\n",

When it arrived, it was not the \"Exotic Frangipani\" body oil as pictured.  The photo is misleading.  Although the bottle shape is the same, the picture shows the label as saying \"Exotic Frangipani\", but the bottles sent are labeled without the \"Exotic\"  and the formula is different from what I had been using.  Very disappointing, however I kept one bottle.\n",

I notice the deep squint lines between my eyes are somewhat lessened as are other lines on my face. I read that a face product is supposed to be most beneficial when used over night so I use it then. I also put it on again first thing after washing my face in the morning and let it soak in before applying moisturizer and my foundation. I recommend it to anyone who wants an affordable retinol cream. In fact, I started using it after my dematologist recommended it, saying it was a good non-prescription retinol product .\n",

My 5 year old was not going to stop...but this product stopped his thumbed sucking in less than 4 days.  Awesome!!! Just as an added bonus, I talked his nail biting Dad into trying some as well...I can't believe it is working on him too.  He has been biting his nails for 48 years!!Love it, highly recommend to others.\n",
       "367393    I love this mask. It makes your face so smooth. I use to buy it in the packets but now that I think it may be discontinued I decided to buy the big bottle. It is different from other masks in that it is clear but make no mistake it works. And it means you can wear it around the house without scaring anyone in the house or that comes to the door. I recommend it to anyone that wants a gentle exfoliator. I have cystic acne and I think it helps. It definitely doesn't make it worse. I wear this mask once a week followed by the acne sulfur mask and I think that really helps with my acne.  If my skin is irritated already it might sting/burn a little but other than that it usually does not burn. You only need a little because if you put too much it will run and drip once it heats up with your body temp. Of this bottle I only use 1.5 pumps. I could usually get 2-3 uses out of the packets. You may want to buy the packets first if you haven't tried it but if you like it then this is definitely worth buying.\n",
